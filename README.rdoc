== README

This is intended to reproduce https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/issues/208

You'll also need to grab https://github.com/steveklabnik/blorgh

Finally, you'll need to change Gemfile references in both the app and the
engine to point at your own copy of rails and blorgh, rather than mine.

=== The issue

Basically, 

    def utt_url
      app.routes.url_helpers.root_path
      #Blorgh::Engine.routes.url_helpers.root_path
    end

This doesn't work. Flip the comments, and it does. This is a bug.

You can find this code in the Blorgh repo, app/serializers/blorgh_serializer.rb

You can get an entry by spinning up a server,

    $ bin/rails s

hitting the right page

    $ open http://localhost:3000/blog/posts/new

Filling out the form, then hitting create. It should redirect you to

    http://localhost:3000/blog/posts/1

Which should give you the serialized json.

If I make a change to Rails:

diff --git a/actionpack/lib/action_controller/railtie.rb b/actionpack/lib/action_controller/railtie.rb
index 5379547..831c007 100644

         extend ::ActionController::Railties::Helpers
 
         options.each do |k,v|

It still doesn't actually fix things. Drat.
